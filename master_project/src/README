1. Install conda environment using environment.yml
2. pip uninstall sentencepiece (causes segfault)
3. Install separate conda environment for whisper speaker diarization libraries (conflicting versions with first environemnt)

(To install pytorch, torchvision, torchaudio and CUDA with the right versions run: 'conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia'.
This has to be done in order to prevent compability issues between the versions we need for our feature extractor and to run our code on the GPU.)
