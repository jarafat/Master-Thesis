Following steps have to be done in order to get the feature extraction script running:
	1. Create an anaconda virtual environment and activate it

	2. Run: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

	3. To install pytorch, torchvision, torchaudio and CUDA with the right versions run: 'conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia'.
	   This has to be done in order to prevent compability issues between the versions we need for our feature extractor and to run our code on the GPU.

	4. Sound backend setup for pytorch and pyannote
		4.1 Use miniconda3 to install sndfile: 'conda install -c conda-forge libsndfile'. This will install the sndfile library in our ~/miniconda3/lib/ directory.
		(4.2 Write following line in your .bashrc: 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/miniconda3/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH'. Here, i am assuming that you have your miniconda3 installed
		    in the home directory. This has to be done so the soundfile.py is able to find our installed libsndfile.so to use it as an audio backend.)

	NOTE: if encountering segmentation fault, following steps fixed it for me:
		1. 'pip uninstall sentencepiece' (caused segfault according to gdb)
		2. 'pip install protobuf==3.9.2'
